### Project Proposal: **Electric Vehicle Charging Station Scheduling System**

#### **Objective**
To design and implement a scheduling system for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations using **C++**, leveraging core Operating System (OS) concepts such as scheduling, resource allocation, and synchronization. The system will manage charging schedules efficiently by prioritizing vehicles based on factors like battery levels, waiting times, and user-defined priorities.

---

### **Problem Statement**
Electric vehicle charging stations face challenges such as:
1. Limited charging ports.
2. High waiting times for vehicles with critical battery levels.
3. Suboptimal resource allocation leading to inefficient use of charging infrastructure.

This project aims to address these challenges by implementing an **OS-inspired scheduling mechanism**.

---

### **Proposed Solution**
A scheduling system will be developed using **C++** that emulates CPU scheduling techniques in Operating Systems to efficiently manage EV charging schedules. The system will:
1. Dynamically allocate charging slots.
2. Optimize charging order using priority, waiting time, and battery levels.
3. Ensure fair and efficient resource allocation by utilizing OS concepts.

### **How OS Concepts Are Utilized**

1. **Process Scheduling**:
   - EVs are treated as "processes" waiting for the resource (charging ports).
   - Scheduling algorithms such as **FCFS**, **Priority Scheduling**, and **Round-Robin** will be adapted for EV charging:
     - **FCFS**: Vehicles are charged in the order they arrive.
     - **Priority Scheduling**: Vehicles with critically low battery levels or VIP users are given higher priority.
     - **Round-Robin**: Each vehicle gets an equal time slice at the charging port.

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Charging ports are the "resources" being allocated.
   - Techniques for resource allocation, inspired by OS models, will be used to avoid deadlock or starvation:
     - **Deadlock Avoidance**: Ensure vehicles are not stuck in a waiting state indefinitely.
     - **Fair Scheduling**: Balance priority and fairness, ensuring all vehicles get charged.

3. **Synchronization**:
   - For multi-port charging stations, synchronization mechanisms (like semaphores in OS) will ensure:
     - No two vehicles are allocated the same charging port simultaneously.
     - Real-time updates to the queue when vehicles arrive or leave.

4. **Timers**:
   - OS timers are analogous to tracking remaining charging times for each vehicle.
   - Implement timers in C++ to:
     - Preempt charging for Round-Robin scheduling.
     - Estimate completion time for all vehicles in the queue.

5. **Queues**:
   - OS process queues (ready queue, waiting queue) are directly mirrored in the charging station system:
     - Vehicles waiting for a port will be in the **ready queue**.
     - Vehicles currently charging will be in the **active queue**.

### **Scheduling Techniques**
The following OS-inspired scheduling techniques will be implemented:

1. **First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS)**:
   - Vehicles are charged in the order they arrive.
   - Pros: Simple and fair.
   - Cons: May lead to starvation for critical vehicles.

2. **Priority Scheduling**:
   - Vehicles with higher priority (e.g., low battery, emergency vehicles) are charged first.
   - Priority is dynamically calculated based on:
     - Battery level (e.g., vehicles with <20% battery).
     - User tier (e.g., VIP users).
   - Pros: Ensures critical vehicles are charged promptly.
   - Cons: May lead to starvation for low-priority vehicles.

3. **Round-Robin Scheduling (RR)**:
   - Each vehicle is allocated a fixed charging time slice (quantum).
   - If charging is not completed within the quantum, the vehicle goes back to the waiting queue.
   - Pros: Prevents monopolization of charging ports.
   - Cons: May increase overall charging time.

4. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**:
   - Vehicles requiring the least amount of charging time are prioritized.
   - Pros: Minimizes overall waiting time.
   - Cons: May cause starvation for vehicles requiring more charging time.

5. **Multi-Level Queue Scheduling** (Optional for advanced scenarios):
   - Separate queues for different user types:
     - **Queue 1**: Emergency vehicles.
     - **Queue 2**: VIP users.
     - **Queue 3**: Regular users.
   - Each queue uses its own scheduling algorithm, with higher-priority queues getting more charging time.

### **Implementation Plan**

#### **1. Data Structures**
- **Priority Queue**:
  - To implement Priority and SJF scheduling.
  - Vehicles are prioritized dynamically based on battery level and waiting time.

- **Circular Queue**:
  - To manage Round-Robin scheduling.

- **Array/Linked List**:
  - To implement simple FCFS scheduling.

#### **2. Modules**
1. **Input Module**:
   - Accepts vehicle details:
     - Vehicle ID.
     - Battery percentage.
     - Priority level (Low, Medium, High).

2. **Scheduling Module**:
   - Implements selected scheduling algorithm.
   - Dynamically updates schedules as vehicles arrive or leave.

3. **Resource Allocation Module**:
   - Allocates charging ports to vehicles based on scheduling output.
   - Tracks remaining charging time and updates status in real-time.

4. **Output Module**:
   - Displays the current charging schedule, including:
     - Vehicle ID.
     - Charging port allocation.
     - Estimated time to completion.

### **Example Workflow**
1. **Input**:
   - User inputs vehicle details:
     ```plaintext
     Vehicle ID: 101
     Battery Level: 15%
     Priority: High
     ```
2. **Scheduling**:
   - Based on the Priority Scheduling algorithm:
     ```plaintext
     Queue:
     1. Vehicle 101 (Priority: High)
     2. Vehicle 102 (Priority: Medium)
     3. Vehicle 103 (Priority: Low)
     ```
3. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Charging Port 1: Vehicle 101 (High Priority)
   - Charging Port 2: Vehicle 102 (Medium Priority)
4. **Output**:
   ```plaintext
   Current Charging Schedule:
   1. Vehicle 101: Charging at Port 1 (Estimated Time: 30 mins)
   2. Vehicle 102: Waiting for Port 1
   3. Vehicle 103: Waiting for Port 1
   ```

### **Evaluation**
1. **Fairness**:
   - Ensures that no vehicle waits indefinitely (avoids starvation).
2. **Efficiency**:
   - Optimizes utilization of charging ports.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Can handle multiple charging ports and large queues.

- **Week 1**: Research OS scheduling techniques and finalize system design.
- **Week 2**: Implement the scheduling algorithms in C++.
- **Week 3**: Develop input and output modules for user interaction.
- **Week 4**: Integrate resource allocation and synchronization.

### **Future Enhancements**
1. Integrate with a GUI using **Qt** or **SFML** to visualize schedules.
2. Add predictive scheduling using machine learning.
3. Introduce a logging system to analyze charging station performance.
